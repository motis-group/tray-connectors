## How to use

1. Finding Your API Key and Secret

To get started, follow these simple steps to locate your API Key and Secret within your JustCall account:

1. Login: Sign in to your JustCall account to access your dashboard.
2. Settings: Click on the profile icon and navigate to 'Settings.'
3. Developers: Navigate to the Developers section from the left panel.
4. Retrieve Credentials: Use the copy button beside the API Key and Secret fields to copy the credentials and store them safely in your clipboard for use in the further steps.
Authenticating API Requests

Now that you have your API Key and Secret, you can use them to authenticate your API requests. When authenticating into the connector, make sure you write the access token in the format: `api_key:api_secret`

This combination of API Key and Secret, separated by a colon, establishes your identity and grants you access to the JustCall APIs.
